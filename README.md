# Expression_Parser

 Simple math solver with variables, goniometric functions, logarithms, etc. Original thought was from year 2010. I strongly inspired myself on "codeproject.com" when I was created this simple expression parser. After years I come back to project and finally finished it. The last thing to do is add some support for Vectors and Matrices (probably by external library).
