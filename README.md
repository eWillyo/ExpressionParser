# Expression parser

 Simple math solver with variables, goniometric functions, logarithms, etc. Original thought comes from 2010. I strongly inspired myself on "codeproject.com" when I was creating this esay to implement expression parser. After years I came back to project and finally finished it. 
 
 TODO: The last thing to do is add some support for vectors and matrices (probably solved by external library).
